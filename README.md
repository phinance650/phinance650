## About Me
Hello! I'm Gavin, a high school senior passionate about Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, and 3D Printing. My goal is to pursue a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, with a strong interest in exploring the boundaries of technology and innovation.  

## My Learning Path
I've been fortunate to have supportive parents who encouraged my curiosity from a young age. My journey in engineering started with a fascination for how things work, leading me to robotics, 3D printing, and programming. I continue to build my skills through hands-on projects, camps, and specialized programs that push my limits.

## Projects

### 1. **TurtleBot4 Autonomous Robot [Purr Patrol]: Cat Behavior Modification**
- **Description**: "Purr Patrol" is an autonomous robotics project designed to monitor and correct the behavior of my Sphynx cats based on TurtleBot infrastructure.  When completed, the agent will be Equipped with behavior recognition capabilities and a water cannon by which the system identifies when cats are scratching furniture and gently intervenes to guide them toward better habits.
- **Challenges**: Developing precise detection algorithms to identify when cats are scratching the furniture, and calibrating the water cannon's aim. This project highlighted the prererquisites to learning robotics which spans CS, EE and ME. [See prerequisites]
- **Approach**: I used Python for programming the robot's logic, integrating sensors for motion detection, and 3D-printed components to enhance the robot's structure.

### 2. **SHAPE Program at Columbia University**
- **Description**: Participated in the Summer High School Academic Program for Engineers (SHAPE) at Columbia University, where I gained deeper insights into engineering principles.
- **Highlights**: Worked on team-based projects, explored new software tools, and learned advanced problem-solving techniques.
- **Project Repository**: Coming soon!

## My Approach to Learning
Learning is not always linear, and Iâ€™ve faced my fair share of challenges along the way. I focus on breaking down problems into smaller components, experimenting with different solutions, and refining my understanding through continuous feedback. My GitHub projects showcase both my successes and the challenges I encounter as I learn.

### Challenges Faced
- The learning curve is super steep in robotics (CS, ME & EE). I've been super fortunate to have help wiring up enviorments for me to play with. Special thanks to [@wmcclinton](https://github.com/wmcclinton) for their contributions to [PyLego](https://github.com/wmcclinton/pylego).
- Understanding complex algorithms and applying them to real-world robotics scenarios.
- Balancing theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation.
- Learning from failures and using them as stepping stones for growth.

### My Vision
I aim to contribute to the field of Mechanical Engineering through innovative research and development, ultimately earning a PhD to deepen my expertise. I believe that curiosity and persistence are the keys to achieving breakthroughs in technology.

## Let's Connect!
I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and learning from others. Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me if you share similar interests!
