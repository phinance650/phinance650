## About Me
Hello! I'm Gavin, a high school senior passionate about Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, and 3D Printing. My goal is to pursue a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, with a strong interest in exploring the boundaries of technology and innovation.  

## My Learning Path
I've been fortunate to have supportive parents who encouraged my curiosity from a young age. My journey in engineering started with a fascination for how things work, leading me to robotics, 3D printing, and programming. I continue to build my skills through hands-on projects, camps, and specialized programs that push my limits.

## Projects

### 1. **TurtleBot4 Autonomous Robot: Cat Behavior Modification**
- **Description**: This project involves creating an autonomous robot that uses a water cannon to gently spray our cats when they scratch the furniture.
- **Challenges**: Developing precise detection algorithms to identify when cats are scratching the furniture, and calibrating the water cannon's aim.
- **Approach**: I used Python for programming the robot's logic, integrating sensors for motion detection, and 3D-printed components to enhance the robot's structure.

### 2. **SHAPE Program at Columbia University**
- **Description**: Participated in the Summer High School Academic Program for Engineers (SHAPE) at Columbia University, where I gained deeper insights into engineering principles.
- **Highlights**: Worked on team-based projects, explored new software tools, and learned advanced problem-solving techniques.
- **Project Repository**: Coming soon!

### 3. **3D Printing Enthusiast**
- **Description**: Iâ€™ve been 3D printing since I was a kid, exploring designs ranging from simple toys to complex mechanical parts.
- **Challenges**: Perfecting the calibration of the printer and designing objects with precise measurements.
- **Approach**: Constant experimentation and iteration, utilizing CAD software to design and refine models.

## My Approach to Learning
Learning is not always linear, and Iâ€™ve faced my fair share of challenges along the way. I focus on breaking down problems into smaller components, experimenting with different solutions, and refining my understanding through continuous feedback. My GitHub projects showcase both my successes and the challenges I encounter as I learn.

### Challenges Faced
- Understanding complex algorithms and applying them to real-world robotics scenarios.
- Balancing theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation.
- Learning from failures and using them as stepping stones for growth.

### My Vision
I aim to contribute to the field of Mechanical Engineering through innovative research and development, ultimately earning a PhD to deepen my expertise. I believe that curiosity and persistence are the keys to achieving breakthroughs in technology.

## Let's Connect!
I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and learning from others. Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me if you share similar interests!
